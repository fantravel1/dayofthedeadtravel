## 🌍 Overview

**DayOfTheDeadTravel.com** is a travel site built for one purpose:

> **Helping people experience Day of the Dead with reverence, understanding, and care.**

This is not entertainment travel.

This is:
- remembrance  
- family  
- grief  
- continuity  
- joy-with-sadness  
- love across generations  

The site exists to **re-educate through beauty**, not scold.

---

## 🎯 Prime Directive: This Is Not Halloween

This must be stated clearly and gently.

Hard lines:

- ❌ No costume tourism framing  
- ❌ No “spooky” language  
- ❌ No party-first positioning  
- ❌ No sugar-skull caricature culture  

Day of the Dead is not a theme.

It is:
> **a living relationship with ancestors.**

---

## 🧠 Core Positioning: A Journey of Memory

DayOfTheDeadTravel is about:

- honoring ancestors  
- understanding rituals  
- witnessing family devotion  
- learning how grief is held communally  

This is emotional travel.

Not entertainment.

## 🇲🇽 Mexico Is Not One Day of the Dead (Regional Truth)

Most sites fail because they treat Mexico as one tradition.

DayOfTheDeadTravel treats regions as distinct living cultures.

### Core Regional Hubs

- **Oaxaca** → altars, artistry, community rituals  
- **Michoacán (Pátzcuaro, Janitzio)** → lake ceremonies, night vigils  
- **Mexico City** → modern expression + ancestral roots  
- **Puebla** → food, home altars  
- **Yucatán (Hanal Pixán)** → Maya-specific cosmology  

Each hub includes:
- different dates  
- different rituals  
- different meanings  
- different etiquette expectations  

This is how the site shows respect.

---

## 🧭 How to Be a Respectful Witness (Essential Page)

This becomes one of the most important pages on the internet.

Guidance includes:

- when photography is inappropriate  
- how to behave in cemeteries  
- what offerings mean  
- what not to touch  
- how to dress respectfully  
- when to observe silently  
- how to ask permission  

This builds enormous trust.

---

## 🕯️ Altars Are Not Decor — They Are Language

This is a core educational pillar.

Altars are not props.

They are:
> **a conversation with the dead.**

DayOfTheDeadTravel explains:
- elements of an altar  
- what marigolds symbolize  
- why food is placed  
- photos vs memory  
- the role of scent, sound, and light  

This reframes altars as:
> language, not aesthetics.

---

## 🍞 Food as Love, Not Cuisine

Day of the Dead food is not “must-try content.”

It is:
- remembrance  
- favorite meals  
- continuity  
- shared tables  

Pan de muerto, mole, tamales are explained as:
> acts of care.

---

## 🧑🏽 Indigenous & Local Voices Lead (Non-Negotiable)

DayOfTheDeadTravel is built with:
- Mexican writers  
- Indigenous voices  
- regional historians  
- family stories  
- bilingual Spanish / English publishing  

All contributors are:
- paid  
- credited  
- protected  

Otherwise:
> don’t publish.

---

## 💔 Grief Without Exploitation

This site must be emotionally intelligent.

It acknowledges:
- loss  
- migration  
- distance from ancestors  
- diaspora grief
